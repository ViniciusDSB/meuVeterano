This is a side project; It is everything i wanted to be in when i started:
    for learning purposes;
    source for students of my college, they shoudl be able to download content
    such as tests abd execise lists of previous semesters;
    I should be able to teach my friends about everything i learnign doign this;

The doc.txt is far from being a final documentation of the project; I wrote it 
basicaly for myself to remember what  was doing and how the parts of the project work, so anyone who read it should be able to do so too;

There is a lots of weird comments aroudn the code, just ignore them :)
I hope things here are not too much cursed!
To run the project read the begginign of doc.txt
