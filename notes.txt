Create an upload ubject, the private methods are the functions that receive the data from the user
they check everything
the public method is the one that receive the informations, including if it's and upload from the 
the staff or from a user. Depending on the arguments it creates and upload for different folder
with different metadata.

flow idea:
when the page loaded it creates a new instande of Class upload();
it parses the data from the input fields;
the upload data is given to a constructor that builds the upload;
it set or not a value with any error that can occour during the building;
then we check if some error occur it`s appened to an erro string;
the upload can now start, one by one except the ones with error;
the oned with errors are stored in a different lsit fot further use;
the uploads are stored and the upload is started externaly, it uploads one by one
so if one upload goes wrong it is store outside of the queue and the other upload can keep going on

seems like a good idea do just throw the files in a folder separed in folder such as INFI, INMA an so on;

After that it shows the results that matches the keywords and if a result that doesn't mach all of the worlds
it can show results each word.
